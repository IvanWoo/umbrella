 * updates/re-renders canvas with each new input received from `body`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * If `size` is subscribable, the canvas is resized each time a new value is
 * received, else will only be used to define initial canvas size.
 *
 * If given a sub (for size) and it has not (yet) produced a value, a default
 * canvas size of 1x1 pixel will be used.
 *
 * The `attribs` SHOULD not include `width`, `height`, since these will be
 * overriden in any way by `size` arg.
