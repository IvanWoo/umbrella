/**
 * Takes a shape and a boundary (both convex), then uses the Sutherland-Hodgeman
 * algorithm to compute a clipped version of the shape (against the boundary)
 * and returns an array of resulting clipped shape(s) or `undefined` if there're
 * no remaining result vertices (i.e. if the original shape was clipped
 * entirely).
 *
 * @remarks
 * Internally uses
 * [`sutherlandHodgeman()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-clip-poly/functions/sutherlandHodgeman.html).
 * For groups, calls itself for each child shape individually and returns a new
 * group of results (if any).
 *
 * For {@link ComplexPolygon}s, children are only processed if the main boundary
 * hasn't been completely clipped. Similarly for closed paths, where sub-paths
 * (holes) are only processed if the clipped main path has remaining vertices.
 *
 * Paths are always first sampled/converted to polygons or polylines.
 *
 * Currently implemented for:
 *
 * - {@link Circle}
 * - {@link ComplexPolygon}
 * - {@link Ellipse}
 * - {@link Group}
 * - {@link Line}
 * - {@link Path}
 * - {@link Polygon}
 * - {@link Quad}
 * - {@link Triangle}
