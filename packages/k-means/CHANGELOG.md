#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- testrunner to binary ([4ebbbb2](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/4ebbbb2))
  this commit reverts (partly) changes made in:
  ef346d7a8753590dc9094108a3d861a8dbd5dd2c
  overall purpose is better testament ergonomics:
  instead of having to pass NODE_OPTIONS with every invocation
  having a binary to handle this for us.

### [0.4.1](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/k-means@0.4.1) (2021-10-13)

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- update imports in all pkgs ([5fa2b6f](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/5fa2b6f))

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/k-means@0.4.0) (2021-10-12)

#### üõë Breaking changes

- major update of ALL pkgs (export maps, ESM only) ([0d1d6ea](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/0d1d6ea))
- BREAKING CHANGE: discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions
  - only ESM modules will be published from now on
  - CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
    - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
    - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
  - switch from mocha to [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament) for all tests

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- update all tests in _all_ pkgs ([8b582bc](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/8b582bc))
  - update all to use [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament)
- update all test stubs ([f2d6d53](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/f2d6d53))
- update imports ([138571a](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/138571a))
- update deps & imports in various pkgs ([e1cf29e](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/e1cf29e))
  - largely related to recent updates/restructuring of these packages:
    - api
    - defmulti
    - errors
    - logger
