 * by the actual node `fn` used. Most node functions with multiple inputs will
 * be implemented as
 * [`StreamSync`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/rstream/classes/StreamSync.html)

/**
 * Specification for a single input, which can be given in different ways:
 *
 * 1) Create a stream for given path in state atom (passed to
 *    {@link initGraph}):
 *
 * ```js
 * { path: "nested.src.path" }
 * { path: ["nested", "src", "path"] }
 * ```
 *
 * 2) Reference path to another node's output in the GraphSpec object. See
 *    [thi.ng/resolve-map](https://thi.ng/resolve-map) for details.
 *
 * ```js
 * { stream: "/node-id/node" } // main node output
 * { stream: "/node-id/outs/foo" } // specific output
 * ```
 *
 * 3) Reference another node indirectly. The passed in `resolve` function can be
 *    used to lookup other nodes, with the same logic as above. E.g. the
 *    following spec looks up the main output of node "abc" and adds a
 *    transformed subscription, which is then used as input for current node.
 *
 * ```js
 * { stream: (resolve) => resolve("/abc/node").map(x => x * 10) }
 * ```
 *
 * 4) Provide an external input stream:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { fromIterable } from "@thi.ng/rstream";
 *
 * { stream: () => fromIterable([1,2,3], 500) }
 * ```
 *
 * 5) Single value input stream:
 *
 * ```js
 * { const: 1 }
 * { const: () => 1 }
 * ```
 *
 * If the optional `xform` is given, a subscription with the given transducer is
 * added to the input and then used as input instead.
