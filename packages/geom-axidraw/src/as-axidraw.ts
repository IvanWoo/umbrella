/**
 * Lazily converts given shape (or group) into an iterable of thi.ng/axidraw
 * drawing commands, using optionally provided config options.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The provided conversion options can (and will) be overridden by a shape's
 * `__axi` attribute. See {@link AxiDrawAttribs} for details.
 *
 * Currently supported shape types (at least all types which are supported by
 * the
 * [`asPolyline()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom/functions/asPolyline.html)
 * function):
 *
 * - arc
 * - circle
 * - complexpoly
 * - cubic
 * - ellipse
 * - group
 * - line
 * - path
 * - points
 * - polygon
 * - polyline
 * - quad
 * - quadratic
 * - rect
 * - triangle
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { circle } from "@thi.ng/geom";
 * import { asAxiDraw } from "@thi.ng/geom-axidraw";
 *
 * [...asAxiDraw(circle(100), { samples: 100 })]
 * [
 *   [ 'm', [ 10, 0 ] ],
 *   [ 'd' ],
 *   [ 'm', [ 9.980267284282716, 0.6279051952931337 ], undefined ],
 *   ...
 * ]
 * ```
