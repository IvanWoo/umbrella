- major update of ALL pkgs (export maps, ESM only) ([0d1d6ea](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/0d1d6ea))
- BREAKING CHANGE: discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions
  - only ESM modules will be published from now on
  - CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
    - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
    - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
  - switch from mocha to [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament) for all tests

  - build scripts now first build ES6 modules in package root, then call
    `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib`

    (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of
    all unused imported symbols.
