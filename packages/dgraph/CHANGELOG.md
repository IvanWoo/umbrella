    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
  - switch from mocha to [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament) for all tests
