# [3.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/rle-pack@3.0.0) (2021-10-12)

#### 🛑 Breaking changes

- major update of ALL pkgs (export maps, ESM only) ([0d1d6ea](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/0d1d6ea))
- BREAKING CHANGE: discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions
  - only ESM modules will be published from now on
  - CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
    - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
    - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
  - switch from mocha to [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament) for all tests

#### ♻️ Refactoring

- update all tests in _all_ pkgs ([8b582bc](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/8b582bc))
  - update all to use [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament)
- update imports ([138571a](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/138571a))
- update various benchmarks ([53e8a6a](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/53e8a6a))

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/rle-pack@2.1.0) (2019-07-07)

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/rle-pack@2.0.0) (2019-01-21)

#### 🛑 Breaking changes

- update package build scripts & outputs, imports in ~50 packages ([b54b703](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/b54b703))
- BREAKING CHANGE: enabled multi-outputs (ES6 modules, CJS, UMD)
  - build scripts now first build ES6 modules in package root, then call
    `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib`
  - all imports MUST be updated to only refer to package level
    (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of
    all unused imported symbols.

#### ♻️ Refactoring

- use arrow fns ([6eba241](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/6eba241))

# [1.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/rle-pack@1.0.0) (2018-08-24)

  - rename => encode() / decode()
  - decode() returns Uint8/16/32Array based on given word size
  - add encode() error handling (arg checks)
  - update tests & readme
  - add diagram
- BREAKING CHANGE: new API and encoding format, see readme
  for details

#### 🚀 Features
