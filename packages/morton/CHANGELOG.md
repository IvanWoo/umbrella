  - CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
    - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
    - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete

    `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib`
  - all imports MUST be updated to only refer to package level
    (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of
    all unused imported symbols.
