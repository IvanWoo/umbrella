# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in any of the projects part of the
**thi.ng/umbrella** monorepo, please **report them**! Thank you!

1. Send an email to `security at thi.ng`.
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome â€” please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or
mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome,
and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the
vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
