[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/shader-graph/)

Minimal shader graph setup based on
[@thi.ng/webgl](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/webgl),
[@thi.ng/shader-ast](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/shader-ast)
and
[@thi.ng/scenegraph](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/scenegraph).

This project was developed from scratch during the [2nd thi.ng
livestream](https://makertube.net/w/aTZXyecXhcexvt9G3hNX15). Please see video
for further detailed discussion. The only changes made after the recording were
some updates to the actual 4 shaders.

## Usage

Left click (or touch) on any of the squares to drag them. Right click to rotate.
When clicking + dragging on empty space, the entire canvas contents will be
moved / rotated.

## Building

Please also refer to the [example build
instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions)
on the wiki.
