[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/fft-synth/)

Basic inverse FFT synth with randomized auto sequencer to trigger
frequency bins and delay line with pitch shift.

The "sequencer" (click the "Auto mode" button to enable) uses a weighted
random function to prioritize lower frequency bins. You can change the
weighting function in
[automode.ts](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/examples/fft-synth/src/automode.ts).The
delay line doesn't store samples, but entire spectrums. Delay period is
currently hard coded to 80 frames (see
[audio.ts](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/examples/fft-synth/src/audio.ts)).

Some explanations for various parameters / controls:

- **Decay** - bin gain decay factor. Lower values result in shorter sounds.
- **Attenuation** - exponential gain decay for higher frequency bins.
  Higher values will make higher frequency bins decay faster.
- **Feedback** - feedback amount of previous spectrums (read from delay
  buffer) mixed with current spectrum. Each time a spectrum is read from
  the delay line it's shifted upwards by one bin, resulting in a subtle
  pitch shift effect.

and I might add some presets.
