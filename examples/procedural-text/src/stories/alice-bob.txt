# our modular main story, at last...
# here we create 2 new vars (hero1 & hero2), each initialized with random values
# if multiple values are available for a var, each time a new value is picked,
# we ensure it's different than the last picked value...

<intro>, <hero1=name> and <hero2=name> went to <place> (<remark>). <hero1> did some <activity>, but <hero2> chose to go <activity> instead. Pretty soon, <drama>.
