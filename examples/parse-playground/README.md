[Visit playground](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/parse-playground/)

This project was largely created during the very first [thi.ng/umbrella
livestream](https://makertube.net/w/ursFuQNJQQskmejx1ydL7q) on 2020-07-10. Feel
free to visit and rewatch the video for more details.

The only additional features added afterwards are:

- editor state serialized using
  [msgpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ygoe/msgpack) (and base64) as
  URI hash for easier sharing/bookmarking
- added multiple test inputs (with tabbed UI) for easier testing and
  specifying different inputs for different parser rules
- added 3rd codegen template (now: TS, ESM & CommonJS)
- added various comments in the source code and some minor cleanup

Please refer to the [example build
instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions)
on the wiki.
