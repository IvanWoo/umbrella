# hdom-local-render

[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/hdom-local-render/)

This example is a proof-of-concept, demonstrating how to:

- Re-render on-demand only a component's subtree, independently from the
  main DOM update cycle
- Use
  [@thi.ng/memoize](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/memoize)
  to simplify usage of higher-order components (with local state or
  without)

Please refer to the [example build
instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions)
on the wiki.
